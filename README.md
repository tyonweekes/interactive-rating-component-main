## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

On the CSS side, I learned how to add circle backgrounds to icons and text. For JavaScript, I learned how to toggle the display property of an element from none to block. I also learned about textContent to change text in a span element. I knew how to change HTML before this. I also relearned that you have to put the script element at the end of the document when selecting DOM elements. They have to be above it.

### Continued development

I would like more practice with CRUD apps, as well as APIs. I also feel like there may be an easier way of handling the logic for something like the rating selection. Perhaps forEach?
